* Introduction
** What do we care about?

Things chemistry/materials-related:

- What are the properties of atoms?
- What molecules do they make?  What other substances do they make?
- What are the shapes of those molecules?  Structures of those solids?  Properties of them?
- How do those substances react with each other?
- What are the energies of those reactions?
- What are the rates of those reactions?
- What is the strongest substance?
- How do we make a substance to do....?
- add your own questions....

Things that relate to the /chemical/ properties of substances.

** How are we going to figure these out?  With only a computer?
- 1926 :: Erwin Schr\ouml{}dinger equation: $\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$
- 1929 :: Paul Dirac, British physicist

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment of a
  large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus /completely
  known/, and the difficulty lies only in the fact that application of
  these laws leads to equations that are /too complex to be solved/.

  It therefore becomes desirable that /approximate practical methods/ of
  applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an
  explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without
  too much computation.

- Today :: Computational ``chemistry'' widely integrated into all aspects of chemical, materials, biological research

``Computational chemistry'' is now so vast it is impossible to cover
everything completely.  We limit ourselves to quantum-mechanics-based
calculations.

** Our goals

1. Understand when it is appropriate to use quantum-mechanics
  methods.
2. Be able to state the basic theoretical, mathematical, and numerical
  concepts behind quantum mechanical ``wavefunction theory'' (WFT) and
  ``density functional theory,'' (DFT) calculations.
3. Understand the terminology and practical issues associated with doing quantum chemical simulations.
4. Get hands-on experience with these concepts using popular
  computational tools of today, including GAMESS for molecular
  systems and Vasp for condensed phase systems.
5. Learn how to apply the results of quantum chemical
  simulations to calculate
  things you care about.
6. Demonstrate an ability to formulate a problem and apply QM
  methods to it.
7. Develop the skills to understand a literature paper in the area.
