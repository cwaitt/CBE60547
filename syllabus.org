* Computational Chemistry
Atomic-scale, simulations have exploded in importance in the last twenty years, largely because of the exponential growth in computing power available to researchers. Chemists, chemical engineers, materials scientists, physicists, geochemists, environmental scientists, ..., now all use atomic scale simulations of one type or another to solve scientific and engineering problems and advance their fields. In fact, the topic is now so broad that it is impossible to capture with one name or to cover completely in one course.

Our emphasis in this course will be on modern approaches to calculating chemical properties using quantum-mechanics-based atomistic simulations. The emphasis is on application rather than theory, but with the recognition that it is impossible to be an intelligent practitioner without some appreciation of underlying theory. I wonâ€™t make any assumptions about your prior knowledge beyond what is typically covered in an undergraduate Physical Chemistry course. 
** Learning goals
1. Understand the basic theoretical, mathematical, and numerical concepts behind  first-principles quantum-mechanics-based calculations.
2. Understand the terminology and practical issues associated with executing and applying these calculations.
3. Gain hand-on experience with these concepts using popular computational tools of today, including /GAMESS/ for molecular systems and /Vasp/ for periodic systems.
4. Learn to interface the results of quantum mechanical calculations with statistical mechanical theories to calculate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters.
5. Propose, execute, and report out on your own computational project.
* (Suggested) Text
Engel and Reid, /Physical Chemistry/, Benjamin-Cummings, 2006 or 2009. Each topic will include some suggested problems from this book to give you practice with the material.
* Lecture
The topics will be presented in a series of self-contained
lectures. Attendance is expected, and you should be prepared to ask
and answer questions. Chapter numbers are for the Second Edition of the suggested reading, "Physical Chemistry". In other editions the chapter numbers will vary, but titles will be the same. 

#+CAPTION: Brief Outline of Course Topics

| Physical Properties of Gases and Liquids   | Chapters 07-11 |
| Introduction to Quantum Mechanics          | Chapters 12-14 |
| Basic Applications of Quantum Mechanics    | Chapters 15-18 |
| Atomic Structure and Spectroscopy          | Chapters 19-22 |
| Molecular Structure and Spectroscopy       | Chapters 23-28 |
| Statistical Thermodynamics                 | Chapters 32-32 |

* Web
This syllabus, reading assignment, the homework assignments and solutions, a summary of the lecture schedule, and a [[https://github.com/wmfschneider/CHE30324/tree/master/Outline/CHE30324-outline.pdf][detailed course outline]] are available on the web at [[https://github.com/wmfschneider/CHE30324]].  If you want to get your own copy of all this material and understand a bit about how git works, see [[http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/]].  Or just download files directly from the git site. The source files are written using Org Mode ([[https://orgmode.org/]]), but you can read them using a regular text editor if you want to see under the hood.

* Homework
Eleven graded problem sets will be distributed during the semester and will be due at the beginning of class on dates to be announced.  *Assignments turned in late will automatically lose 20%, and those turned in after the solutions are posted will not be accepted.*  Your two lowest scores on homework will be dropped.  You may discuss the homework with your classmates, but *what you turn in must be your own work.*
Homework will in general require some computations. You may write out solutions by hand, being mindful that neatness counts. 

** Jupyter/Python
Alternatively, homework will also be distributed as [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter notebooks]] (https://jupyter.org), a powerful, open source computing notebook environment that works within a web browser. Jupyter allows one to do among other things, create and execute [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] (https:/www.python.org) programs, which are similar in syntax to Matlab. Use is optional, but if you are interested, you can download Jupyter and Python as one distribution, at [[http://anaconda.com/download]]. A tutorial on both will be provided outside of regular class hours at a time to be announced.
* Homework Defense
To help me get to know you and how you are doing with the course, after each homework assignment six of you will be chosen at random to meet with me one-on-one to discuss their homework.

* Grading
Grades will be based on homework (25%), three in-class exams (45%), and a cumulative final (30%).

* Academic honesty
Should go without saying. Any cheating or misrepresenting of work as your own will be dealt with according to the Honor Code policies of the university. I reserve the right to relocate any students during an examination at my discretion.

* Professional courtesy
As a courtesy to the instructor and your classmates, please refrain from
texting, web browsing, tweeting, chatting, updating, or using your phone or laptop for any
purpose during class time.  If you must use an electronic device, excuse
yourself from class.

* Office hours
The TA and instructor are happy to answer questions during regular office hours or by appointment if you need extra help.
